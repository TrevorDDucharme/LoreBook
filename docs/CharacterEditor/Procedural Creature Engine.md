Welcome to the Procedural Creature Engine

This engine is designed to give you unprecedented freedom in creature creation, animation, and behavior. Imagine the flexibility of Spore, the depth and diversity of Skyrim characters, and the visual fidelity of Honey-Select — all combined into a single, procedural, real-time system.

Modular Creature Creation

Every creature is built from parts — heads, tails, claws, wings, eyestalks, fins, horns, and more — each defined with rich metadata. This metadata is the engine’s guiding principle: it dictates how parts behave, how they move, interact, and respond to their environment. Prebuilt animations are available, but they are just stylized suggestions; the system always interprets the metadata first. You can add your own meshes, parts, and behaviors at any time, and the engine will integrate them seamlessly into the creature’s body.

You can create anything you can imagine: a werewolf that looks like it might leap off the screen, a two-headed beast with 360-degree vision, a creature with a snake for a tail, or a full-on Lovecraftian monstrosity. The system supports infinite creativity, ensuring your creatures not only look incredible but also behave consistently with their anatomy and parts.

Procedural Skeletons and Sockets

Every creature has a procedural skeleton, dynamically built from its parts. Modular sockets allow parts to connect naturally, and the skeleton adapts in real-time as parts are added or removed. Limbs, appendages, and extremities flex naturally, and the engine supports advanced inverse kinematics (IK) to ensure realistic motion across the entire body, no matter how unconventional the design.

Shape Keys, Remeshing, and Fidelity

The engine supports procedural shape keys, letting creatures deform, express emotions, or adjust body shapes on the fly. When parts connect, procedural remeshing ensures geometry and textures blend seamlessly at the seams. Hair, fur, fins, wings, and other surface parts are fully supported, and particle systems integrate dynamically with shape keys and remeshing.

Texture blending, scars, and wear-and-tear effects are applied procedurally, allowing for realistic interactions between creatures. Claws, teeth, or other damaging parts can leave mesh-level or texture-level scars, and their effectiveness is calculated from metadata like sharpness, durability, and velocity.

AI and Behavior

Every part can be assigned to behavior categories, which the engine’s AI uses to drive interactions and animations. Categories are user-defined and unlimited, meaning a creature can “look at” points of interest with eyestalks, “attack” with claws, or perform custom behaviors specific to its anatomy. Raycasts, fields of vision, and environmental awareness are automatically calculated to ensure behaviors feel emergent and natural.

The AI works with both metadata and procedural rules, so creatures respond intelligently in real-time, no matter how unique or bizarre their anatomy is.

Performance and Scalability

The engine is GPU-accelerated, enabling the kinematics solver, procedural remeshing, and physics to operate simultaneously on hundreds of characters in real-time. Runtime meshes are optimized for speed, ensuring high-fidelity creatures never compromise performance.

Endless Possibilities

Mix and match any parts, custom or prebuilt, and see them behave correctly.

Create creatures with extreme diversity — both visually and behaviorally.

Apply procedural shape keys and remeshing to deform creatures dynamically.

Run AI-driven behaviors that react intelligently to the environment and other creatures.

Experiment with procedural particle systems for hair, fur, and surface effects.

Damage, wear, and procedural interaction are calculated realistically and visually represented.

In short, this is not just a creature editor — it’s a living, breathing sandbox for procedural life. It empowers you to create creatures that are visually stunning, behaviorally rich, and fully dynamic — creatures that feel alive in ways you’ve never seen before.
